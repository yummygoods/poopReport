# poopReport
**A Very Much In Progress app for my dear friend Brandy who needs a way to keep track of some dogs and their... business.** 

## the problem
**Our heroine and her sister join forces so they may care for their aging parents... and subsequently their parents' pets who are in varying degrees of health.**

The newly created, multi-generational household includes:
- The aforementioned parents
- Their dog
- Their cat
- Brandy
- Brandy's sister
- Brandy's sister's two teenaged daughters
- Their 2 dogs
- Their 4 cats

 
**With multiple people now tending to all of the critters**, they need a way to keep track of when the dogs were last walked and fed, did they actually ingest their meds (or did they see right through the peanut butter ruse), did they go peeps and...

... to answer the all-important question,

ðŸ’© **DID THEY POOP?** ðŸ’©

Although texting each other or hollering up the stairs to find out is certainly a way to do it, PoopReport is less yell-y, more reliable and a whole lot cuter.

## the solution
A mobile-friendly web app to report, view and track the status of the household puppers. 

## stack

Poop Report is a full stack app using Java with Springboot for the backend, MySQL for the database and JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the front end.

## current functionality
- register/login with email
- add dogs
- make a report: pooped, peed, walked, ate, took rx
- include a note in the report  
- make another report for same or different dog
- view reports for all of that user's dogs, ordered by most recent
- logout

## TODO

*TIDY UP ALL*
edit comments as needed
delete commented out junk code
refactor actual code eventually
double-check for semantic html
add alt tags to images
change ids to classes where appropriate, go slowly and double-check css
double-check for correct use of h1-h6

*MISC LOOKS STUFF*
try out different fonts
change emojis to images? i don't like the emoji versions that some browsers use

*HEADER + FOOTER*
try thymeleaf for header and footer templates
add 'stop gif play' option ?
add footer content/nav

*ABOUT PAGE*
add project details
add screenshots, etc

## roadmap
- add dog's photo
- additional users on the same account
