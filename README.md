# poopReport
ðŸ’© an app to hopefully avoid pet poopcidents, made with love by melissa averinos

**Poop Report is a Very Much In Progress app I'm making for my dear friend Brandy who needs a way to keep track of some dogs and their... business.** 

## the problem
Our heroine and her sister join forces so they may care for their aging parents... and subsequently their parents' pets who are in varying degrees of health.

The newly created, multi-generational household includes:
- The aforementioned parents
- Their dog
- Their cat
- Brandy
- Brandy's sister
- Brandy's sister's two teenaged daughters
- Their 2 dogs
- Their 4 cats

 
With multiple people now tending to all of the critters, they need a way to keep track of when the dogs had last been walked, if they had been fed, did they actually eat their meds (or did they see right through the peanut butter ruse) and...

... to answer the all-important question,

ðŸ’© **DID THEY POOP?** ðŸ’©

They need a better system than texting each person or hollering up the stairs to find out. 

## the solution
A mobile-friendly web app to report, view and track the status of the household puppers. 

## stack

Poop Report is a full stack app using Java with Springboot for the backend, MySQL for the database and JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the front end.

## current functionality
- register/login with email
- add dogs
- make a report: pooped, peed, walked, ate, took rx
- include a note in the report  
- make another report for same or different dog
- view reports for all of that user's dogs, ordered by most recent
- logout
