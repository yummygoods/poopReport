    <p>
        Poop Report is an app I made for my dear friend Brandy.
        Living in a multi-generational household and caring for her parents' dogs with varying health issues, Brandy
        needed a way for the family to keep track of when the dogs had last been walked, if they had taken their
        prescriptions, eaten...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> and a simple way to answer the all-important question:
    </p>
    <br>
    <!--i want this to be bigger-->
    <p class="bold">ðŸ’© DID THEY POOP? ðŸ’©</p>

    <!--i want some kind of divider here-->

        <!--TODO vary the font style or weight in this section-->


        <p>To start with, Brandy wanted to have a place to record the following for each dog:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Did they get outside to walk?</li>
            <li>Did they pee?</li>
            <li>Did they poop?</li>
            <li>Were they fed?</li>
            <li>Did they eat the food?</li>
            <li>Did they get their meds?</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p> Additional options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>write a comment with each report</li>
            <li>add a "profile photo" for each dog</li>
            <li>upload a photo of the poop! (to help diagnose digestive troubles)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <li>add second user for dogs</li>
            <li>if second user associated with dog, add 'report by user field'</li>
            <li>alert that itâ€™s been a certain number of hours since the dogs went out</li>
