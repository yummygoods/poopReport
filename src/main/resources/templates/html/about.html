    <p>
        Poop Report is an app I made for my dear friend Brandy.
        Living in a multi-generational household and caring for her parents' dogs with varying health issues, Brandy
        needed a way for the family to keep track of when the dogs had last been walked, if they had taken their
        prescriptions, eaten...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> and a simple way to answer the all-important question:
    </p>
    <br>
    <!--i want this to be bigger-->
    <p class="bold">ðŸ’© DID THEY POOP? ðŸ’©</p>

    <!--i want some kind of divider here-->

        <!--TODO vary the font style or weight in this section-->


        <p>For each dog, Brandy wanted to have a place to record the following:</p>
        <ol class="regular-list">
            <li>Did they get outside to walk?</li>
            <li>Did they pee?</li>
            <li>Did they poop?</li>
            <li>Were they fed?</li>
            <li>Did they eat the food?</li>
            <li>Did they get their meds?</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Additionally, Brandy wanted:</p>
        <ul class="regular-list">

        </ul>
